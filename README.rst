**sysmodpy** is a library that offers small convenience functions to do object
oriented modeling in Python.

When given properly type-annotated classes as input, the provided ``decorate``
function provides fluent style getters and setters as well as bidirectional
referential integrety.

Check out the examples in ``sysmodpy/test_*.py``

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

This library was created during the systems modeling of the University of Tartu class in fall 2020.
